# State-of-the-Union
This is a project I worked on during Spring 2019. This particular year's occasion was controversial due to the US government shutdown from December 2018 to January 2019. As a result, the speech was postponed to February. In light of the speech being in the national spotlight, I was inspired to research the history of the speech and investigate the text for trends in topics over time.
